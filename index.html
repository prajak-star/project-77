     Console.log;
     The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console.
      To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.

     Console.log() is used as a debugging tool to help you understand what your code is doing.
     By displaying a message containing either descriptive text that tells you what is happening or the value of particular variables,
     you can follow along as your code executes.

     How to print Console.log message=
     In the code , got to the JavaScript part and then whereever/whenever you want the console code to be , you have to type - 
     console.log(what you want to display in the console); 
     If you want to display a word or a sentance then type- console.log("what you want to display");
     if variable or a function then - console.log(the variable or function's name);
     example- 
     1) var firstname="Lily";
       console.log(firstname); (so in the console lily will be displayed)
     2) console.log("Hi i am lily") (here the sentance will be displayed in the console);
